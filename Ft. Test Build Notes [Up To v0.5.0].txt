*21 June 2021
+v0.0.0.0001
-Added 3 new characters: 'test-opponent-1,' 'test-opponent-5,' and 'test-opponent-6,' for size comparison.
-3 new characters only accesible via debug menu.

+v0.0.0.0002
-Removed 'test-opponent-1' and 'test-opponent-6.' Renamed 'test-opponent-5' to 'test-opponent.'
-Adjusted some of the animation timing.

+v0.0.0.0002(II)
-Adjusted the animations for better timing, with limited success.
-Fixed the down animation (sometimes it would go up at the very end; this was due to a numerical error in the .xml file).
-Transfered the new .xml to source code.

+v0.0.0.0002(III)
-Reset the x- and y-frame variables to zero, set frame width and height to 400 for the time being.
-Adjusted the frame variables to better fit Test. Will adjust for offsets later.
-Transfered the new .xml to source code.

+v0.0.0.0002(IV)
-Listing down frame x,y,w,and h variables respectively for future reference: -150, -400, 700, 1100.
-Adjusted the animation offsets. Left, down, and right require some toggling.
-Corrected the left and right animation offsets.
-Corrected the down animation offset.
-Transfered the new .xml to source code.

+v0.0.5
-The same thing as the final version of v0.0.0002, but properly compiled from the start.

+v0.0.5.0001
-Sent the first draft of the 'test-player' into the game. Several issues need correcting:
--The offsets require more adjustment than previously expected (noted for the future).
--Left notes registering as down notes, needs to be addressed. Right notes (except for misses) load as left notes.
--Death animations aren't loading. 'HEY!' animation is also not responsive.
--The shaking animation, does work, however, which is appreciated.
-While the assets appear to have been ported, the lack of success makes it clear that work must be done.

+v0.0.5.0002
-Corrected a text error in the Character.hx source code which caused some of the earlier issues.
-Left and right are still mistakenly swapped, but left no longer goes down.
-'HEY!' works, Death animations are still MIA.
-Will address the remaining issues via the .xml ... right after doing a quick source code sweep.
-Source code seems clear, will be using the .xml to resolve all further issues. First up: sprite swap.

*22 June 2021
+v0.0.5.0003
-Pulled an epic gamer move and fixed the note swap problem by simply swapping their names. Did not do the same to the misses as they were okay.
-Will address the lack of Death Anims later; for now, moving on to fixing the offsets.
-Not a build update, but I renamed all the Build versions to fit with the revised release plan. NOW onto offsets.

*23 June 2021
+v0.0.5.0003 (Cont.)
-Fixed the idle offsets to test the calculations. Moving on to the others.
-Adjusted all necessary offsets. Now working on what's wrong with the death sprites.
-Holding off on Death Sprite fixes for the next test build. Might also work on optimizing arrown animations for test-player.
-Transfered the new .xml to source code.

+v0.0.5.0004
-Managed to figure out how to perform the Death Animations (thanks, AsswipeCarl & luRaichu).
-Adjusted the death animations for better timing (mostly the death and the loop; the retry was fine).
-Transfered the new .xml to source code.
-Will probably work on player note holding later; gonna remove "Test.hx" from the source code for now.

+v0.1.0
-Re-compiled everything from the ground up.
-Removed the "Test.hx" file.

+v0.1.0.0001
-Successfully added 'test-opponent-car'. Doesn't look like any further fine-tuning is needed.

*24 June 2021
+v0.1.0.0002
-Added the 'test-opponent-christmas' and 'test-opponent-christmas-red' characters, but some fine-tuning needs to happen:
--Check the .xml for 'test-opponent-christmas' for errors in display registry.
--Adjust the positions for 'test-opponent-christmas-red', maybe consider reworking the animation.

*30 June 2021
+v0.1.0.0002 (II)
-Recompiled everything from the ground up to better suit the version; renamed various areas of the .xml and adjusted a numerical error.
--'test-opponent-christmas' is now almost complete. Now to address the down animation issue...
-Fixed the numerical error that caused the regular down animation to hover. 'test-opponent-christmas' is now complete.
-Adjusted 'test-opponent-christmas-red''s positioning to a satisfactory degree. Whoo!
-Transfered the new .xmls to source code.

*1 July 2021
+v0.1.0.0003
-Added the 'test-opponent-pixel' and 'test-opponent-deadpixel' characters; some fixings are required:
--Adjusting '-pixel''s position only slightly; everything else seems to translate well.
--Figure out what's going on with '-deadpixel'; we might have another Week 5 Incident on our hands.
-Also look into fixing bf-pixel's lost death animation.
-Adjusted 'test-opponent-pixel''s positioning.
-Adjusted 'test-opponent-deadpixel''s positioning. Luckily, the glitching from earlier didn't persist.
-Transfered the new .xmls to source code.

*2 July 2021
+v0.1.0.0004
-Hasn't been compiled yet, but masegovia on Discord has helped me fix the lost music issue for pixel BF.

*11 July 2021
+v0.1.0.0004
-Ultimately caved and added the 'bf-' in front of the playable Test.
-On that note, renamed 'test-player' into 'bf-test', and renamed all 'test-opponent's to just 'test' with their respective descriptors.
-Making Test a BF also seems to have resolved the note swap issue from an earlier build... had to swap them back to normal though...
-Recompiled with the death sound fix from earlier. Everything seems to be in working order.
-...if a patch not relying on renaming all assets to 'bf-' comes up, consider implementing it.

*12 July 2021
+v0.1.0.0005
-Added 'bf-test''s car, christmas, and pixel variants to the game.
-Fixed a bug in the source code for christmas and pixel Test that would cause the game to close down upon their debug menu selection.
-Adjusted 'bf-test-pixel''s placement in the .xml. Corrected an error in the spritesheet, and adjusted his death sprite positions.
-Transfered the new .xml and the new spritesheet to the source code.

+v0.2.0
-The same thing as v0.1.0.0005, recompiled from the ground up.

*22 July 2021
+v0.2.0.0001
-With some help from @gedehari on Discord, managed to FINALLY create a build with the Minus character select assets.
-Bad news: Week 6 won't function on story mode, and some tweaking to the GameOverSubstate file will need to be done again...
-Next step is some minor overhauls...

*23 July 2021
+v0.2.0.0002
-Managed to make a mostly functional build with more personalized assets in the Character Select and the Main Menu background.
-Only issues so far are death animation syncing for some of the variants and some offset issues from Test. Will fix the later rn...
-Fixed the CS Test idle offset, still need to finish the select offset and correct the story menu portrait.
-Fixed a coloring issue with the CS on Test's side. Also readjusted the CS icon positions. Will do more later.
-Finished the remaining offset fixes on story mode and for the HEY! anims for CS Test and Story Mode.
-Now onto Discord to fix the Death anims...

*24 July 2021
+v0.2.0.0002 (Cont.)
-Finally figured out how to code the custom death anims (thanks to Daim and masegovia on Discord for helping me through the process).
-Now I can figure out how to set up the Vs Test thing... assuming I wanna do that... Need a quick break first.
-Also forgot to mention this, but you can play Week 6 now.

-Mid-update: Added the logo bumper. Not putting it into a full build for now. Planning on working on the new Story Mode stuff later.

*26 July 2021
+v0.2.0.0003
-Built a barebones setup for the future builds of Test-exclusive Story Mode (and Freeplay versions). Just need to fix the Mode Menu offsets...
-Fixed the Mode Menu offsets, removed the overhead text because it felt out of place.
-To clarify, the reason this version is barebones is because right now, you can only:
--See a grey background instead of the usual yellow in Story Mode (characters are still normal).*
--Play against default Test only in Freeplay Mode.
*-Another problem I discovered; dying in Test Story Mode sends you back to default mode. Need to fix.
-Fixed the Story Mode switchback error. Now to move on to v0.2.0.0004 to flesh out both modes a bit more...

-Mid-update. Got Freeplay mode to show different Tests. Might tackle some Story Mode bits now.

*27 July 2021
+v0.2.0.0004
-Created separate source code channels for Test Story Mode so all the mod stuff can go there.
-Added in new Test Story Mode animations for the antagonists. Also gave the weeks new titles.
-Made the Test Story Mode feature Test exclusively (+his variants).
-Made sure the end of a song would send the player back to the right menu.
-All that leaves is... the teaser Week. *Gulp*

+v0.3.0
-Same thing as the last version, since nothing else is required. Last version before v0.5.0 for the Demo release.
-Scratch that, just fixed an error where completely a Test Story Mode week normally would have led to the default Story Mode Menu. Now it's done.

*28 July 2021
+v0.3.0.0001
-Added in the Test song, and charted for all 3 difficulties.
-Gave the Test Week in Story Mode a placeholder custom week sprite.
-Added the Test song into Freeplay (though current placement is less than ideal...).
-The next build should fix some minor story mode stuff, and the whole Freeplay incident.

*29 July 2021
+v0.3.0.0002
-Fixed the Test in Freeplay issue.
-Added customs Week 6 sprites for Test as Senpai or as BF.
-Added a custom Week 6 sprite for Test as Spirit.
-Added custom dialogue.
-Changed the "Friday Night Funkin" intro text to "FNF Ft Test Demo"
-Added custom intro text. Not sure if it'll show up tho.
-Fixed an error with BF's icons.

+v0.5.0
-Guess it's time to make it official...
